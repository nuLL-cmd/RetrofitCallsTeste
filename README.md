# RetrofitCallsTeste

Api consumption via Retrofit library.

Developed by me as an alternative to consuming JSONObject without the need to use a JSONArray since it is necessary to know the keys of each JSONObject.

In this method it is not necessary to know the data "keys" the objects coming from the request making the consumption much more flexible since it is not necessary in part to know what will be consuming in JSON if it brings objects with random keys.
